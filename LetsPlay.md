# Let's PLay Session

A group of game designers review one game playing it all together. The game review is done in real time from many angles.The purpose is multiple:

1) Help the dev to focus on the right things
2) Grow the knowledges of participants in game design research
3) Have a chance to meet more game designers.

# What is not

In order to understand well the goal of the session, I would like to explain you what it is not. The session is not a meeting to get feedback and opinion about a game. It is a meetup where professionals analyze a game, without comments. It is useful for everyone to learn and improve the ability of play a game like a professional and not like a simple gamer.


# Profiles
The activity requires people to cover specific roles, in order to run correctly. Those are the profiles involved into the activity:

- Dev: member(s) of the game development team
- GD: game designer member of Barcelona Game Design Meetup
- Moderator: moderator of the whole section
- Player(s): play the game to analyze live.
- Audience: people which are not game designers will simply observe the session. At the end, they will be allowed to make comments and ask questions.
- (OPTIONAL) Community Manager: the bridge with online people (if any).

# Step 1 - Game Review
The session start involves directly the members of the development team. They introduce briefly the game and then follow the actual gameplay making comments. They do not play the game directly.
1) Session Introduction (15 mins)
2) Introduction to the game (15 min)
3) 1+ Player plays the last build of the game (30 min)

**NOTE:** GD(s) take notes during the whole session, without interrupting Dev(s) and Player(s).

# Step 2 - Question and Answer
This step is useful for the GD to make more specific questions to the Dev. Everyone continues to take notes. 
The duration of this step is 30 minutes more.

# Step 3 - Game Analysis
This is the final step, and also the longest one. The game is fully dissected, finding everything useful to study it. 

1) Trello board introduction: a Trello board with focus areas is divided and shared with everyone. (15 mins)
2) Dev interview: the developer(s) start to fill up the trello board with notes and comments. (30 min)
3) GDs sharing: GDs share their notes with the audience (30-60 minutes)

Everything is placed into the Trello board, and it will be publicly shared with everyone before of the Let's Play Session.

# Step 4 - Audience comments
In this step, people from the audience will be allowed to make comments and questions about the game or the whole session. Duration: 30 mins.
