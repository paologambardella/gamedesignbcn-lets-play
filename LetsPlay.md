# Let's PLay Session

A group of game designers review one game playing it all together. The game review is done in real time from various angles.The purpose is multiple:

1) Help the designer of the game to focus on the right things
2) Grow the participantsâ€™ knowledges about game design research
3) Have a chance to know more game designers.


# Profiles
The activity requires people to cover specific roles, in order to run correctly. Those are the profiles involved into the activity:

- Dev: member(s) of the game development team
- GD: game designer member of Barcelona Game Design Meetup
- Moderator: moderator of the whole section
- Player(s): play the game to analyze live.
- (OPTIONAL) Community Manager: the bridge with online people (if any).

# Step 1 - Game Review
The session start involves directly the members of the development team. They introduce briefly the game and then follow the actual gameplay making comments. They do not play the game directly.
1) Session Introduction (15 mins)
2) Introduction to the game (15 min)
3) 1+ Player plays the last build of the game (30 min)

**NOTE:** GD(s) take notes during the whole session, without interrupting Dev(s) and Player(s).

# Step 2 - Question and Answer
This step is useful for the GD to make more specific questions to the Dev. Everyone continues to take notes. The duration of this step is 30 minutes more.

# Step 3 - Game Analysis
This is the final step, and also the longest one. The game is fully dissected, finding everything useful to study it. 

1) Trello board introduction: a Trello board with focus areas is divided and shared with everyone. (15 mins)
2) Dev interview: the developer(s) start to fill up the trello board with notes and comments. (30 min)
3) GDs sharing: GDs share their notes with the audience

Everything is placed into the Trello board, and it will be publicly shared with everyone before of the Let's Play Session.
